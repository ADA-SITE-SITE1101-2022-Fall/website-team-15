                    On the 15th of November, at 11 AM, Team 15 (Raig Abdurahmanii, Nijat Alisoy, Firengiz Bekirli, and <br>
                    Nariman Mammadov) conducted the Hour of Code event at Baku School-Lyceum No.20 named after <br>
                    Arif Huseynzada. The event's purpose was to show that anybody can learn the basics of programming.<br>
                    The participants were 24 students between the ages of 12-15. The event began with a brief introduction<br>
                    to ADA University, followed by teammates Nijat and Nariman introducing the fundamentals of coding <br>
                    with "The Classic Maze" on CODE.ORG. Afterwards, we helped the students to solve the puzzles. At the<br>
                    end of the event, certificates were distributed to students who finished the puzzles successfully. We,<br>
                    Team 15, would like to wholeheartedly thank Ms. Chinara Kazimova, an ICT teacher at the school, for<br>
                    assisting us for the whole of our project, providing us with a computer room and excellent students,<br>
                    and special thanks to the Director of School No. 20, Ms. Esmira Agayeva, for allowing our group to<br>
                    come and conduct our project, taking precious education time.

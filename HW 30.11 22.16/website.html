        <h2>Website Project</h2>
        <div>
            <p class="texts">The website project based on CodeAcademy was critical in our learning of both website creation and programming. As first-year students in the School of IT and Engineering, we lacked coding knowledge, so these multi-module HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses came in handy. We learned how the front end is built with HTML, styled with CSS, and animated with JS.<br>The following duties were divided equally among the group members while successfully avoiding collisions:<br>Raiq Abdurahmanli designed a logo and assisted in the coding of the Members page;<br>Nijat assisted in the coding of the Website Project and the Hour of Code page;<br>Nariman coded the structure of the website and created animations using JavaScript in the page while keeping everything under control;<br>Firengiz Bekirli assisted in the development of the Members and Home pages.
